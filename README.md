Minishell - Simple Unix Shell Implementation

Welcome to Minishell, a project that brings the power of a Unix shell to your fingertips. Minishell is a minimalist shell implementation that allows users to interact with the operating system through a command-line interface, providing a lightweight and versatile environment for executing commands and managing processes.

** Project Overview **

- What does Minishell do?
      - Minishell is a simplified Unix shell that interprets and executes commands entered by the user. It provides a command-line interface for interacting with the operating system, allowing users to run programs, manage processes, and navigate the file system. Minishell is an excellent introduction to shell programming and system-level interactions.

- Key Features
      - Command Execution: Minishell interprets and executes commands entered by the user, providing a lightweight and efficient interface for running programs.
      - Environment Variables: The project supports environment variables, allowing users to customize the shell environment and pass information to executed commands.
      - Process Management: Minishell manages processes, enabling users to run commands in the background, foreground, or manage pipelines.

** How to Compile Minishell **

To compile the Minishell program, follow these straightforward steps:

  - Clone the Repository:
        - git clone git@github.com:Bgarnn/03-Minishell.git
        - cd 03-Minishell
  - Compile the Program:
        - make: This will generate the minishell executable.
  - Clean the Build:
        - make clean: This removes the object files, leaving only the compiled program.

** Now you can use Minishell to interact with the operating system through a command-line interface!

** Usage Example

./minishell

(This will start the Minishell prompt, allowing you to enter commands and interact with the shell.)
